2,"Profile grid visual representation as a component with one or two graphs and aditional user interface components like amplification level, aquisition time and so on.",,XL (20)
3,Profile grid data collector passes data to area graph to visualize profile grid.,,XL (20)
9,"Profile Grids in main window should be ordered in particle flight direction, e.g. from bottom to top.",,S (2)
8,"User can choose a PG belonging to a context (chain, particle transfer, virtual accelerator).",Test: Check if PG list looks feasible and selected PG is visualized.,M (5)
6,User can set amplification level of a choosen PG to improve measurement and visualization of PG data graph.,Test: Switch amplification level in GUI and check if PG graph is changing accordingly,M (5)
7,User can choose existing context or virtual accelerator for a specific PG to measure a particular beam.,Test: Switch contexti GUI and check if PG graph is changing accordingly,S (2)
11,X-Axis of the visualized PGs must optionally scale accordingly to visualized PG with the largest X dimensions.,X-Axis of the visualized PGs must optionally scale accordingly to the visualized PG with the largest X dimensions. Same is true for Y-axis. Let the user easily compare profile of various PGs.,M (5)
